# Top 10 List of Week 06

1. [Concurrency](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/concurrency-in-operating-system/)<br>
Concurrency is the execution of the multiple instruction sequences at the same time. It happens in the operating system when there are several process threads running in parallel. The running process threads always communicate with each other through shared memory or message passing. Concurrency results in sharing of resources result in problems like deadlocks and resources starvation. Relative speed of concurrent execution cannot be predicted. It's based on:
* The activites of other processes
* The way operating system handle interrupts
* The scheduling policies of the operating system

2. [Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing))<br>
Process is a program in execution. A process will need CPU time, memory, files, and I/O devices to accomplish its task. These resources are typically allocated to the process while it is executing. Modern operating systems support processes having multiple threads of control. On systems with multiple hardware processing cores, these threads can run in parallel.

3. [Thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5201852/what-is-a-thread-really)<br>
A thread is an independent set of values for the processor registers. It controls the execution orders of a process. It also includes the stack pointer, which had better point to a unique area of memory for each thread or else they will interfere with each other. Threads are the software unit affected by control flow, because those instructions operate on the instruction pointer, and that belongs to a particular thread. Threads are often scheduled according to some prioritization scheme.

4. [Single Threaded Process](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_processes.htm)<br>
Single threaded processes contain the execution of instructions in a single sequence. Which means each command is processed one at a time.

5. [Multithreaded Process](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/single-threaded-and-multi-threaded-processes)<br>
Multithreaded processes allow the execution of multiple parts of a program at the same time. These are lightweight processes available within the process.

6. [Process Scheduling](https://www.guru99.com/process-scheduling.html)<br>
The objective of multiprogramming is to have some process running at all times so as to maximize CPU utilization. The objective of time sharing is to switch a CPU core among processes so frequently that users can interact with each program while it is running. To meet these objectives, the process scheduler selects an available process for program execution on a core. Each CPU core can run one process at a time.

7. [Benefits of Multithreading](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19455-01/806-3461/6jck06gqj/index.html)<br>
The main benefit of multithreading is speeding up application by doing activites concurrently. There are also several other benefits of multithreading:
* Improved throughput. Being able to multiple concurrent compute operations and I/O requests within a single process.
* Simultaneous and fully symmetric use of multiple processors for computation and I/O.
* Superior application responsiveness. If a request can be launched on its own thread, applications do not freeze. An entire application will not block, or otherwise wait, pending the completion of another request.
* Minimized system resource usage. Threads impose minimal impact on system resources. 
* Program structure simplification. Threads can be used to simplify the structure of complex applications, such as server-class and multimedia applications.

8. [Data Parallelism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_parallelism)<br>
Data parallelism is parallelization across multiple processors in parallel computing environments. It focuses on distributing the data across different nodes, which operate on the data in parallel. It can be applied on regular data structures like arrays and matrices by working on each element in parallel.

9. [Multithreading Models](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19455-01/806-3461/6jck06gqk/index.html)<br>
A relationship must exist between user threads and kernel threads. There are several ways to create this relationship.
* Many-to-One Model. This model maps many user-level threads to one kernel thread. The thread management is done by the thread library in user space.
* One-to-One Model. This model maps each user thread to a kernel thread. It provides more concurrency than the many-to-one model by allowing another thread to run when a thread makes a blocking system call.
* Many-to-Many Model. The many-to-many model allows program to have as many thread as needed without making the process to heavy. This model is also the most difficult to implement.

10. [System Call](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/what-are-system-calls-in-operating-system)<br>
The interface between a process and an operating system is provided by system calls. System calls are usually made when a process in user mode requires access to a resource. There are mainly five types of system calls: Process control, File management, Device management, Information maintenance, Communication.
