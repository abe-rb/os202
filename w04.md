# Top 10 List of Week 04

1. [Logical and Physical Address](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/logical-and-physical-address-in-operating-system/)<br>
Logical Address is generated by CPU while a program is running. The logical address is virtual address as it does not exist physically, therefore, it is also known as Virtual Address. This address is used as a reference to access the physical memory location by CPU. The term Logical Address Space is used for the set of all logical addresses generated by a program's perspective. The hardware device called Memory-Management Unit (MMU) is used for mapping logical address to its corresponding physical address. Physical Address identifies a physical location of required data in a memory. The user never directly deals with the physical address but can access by its corresponding logical address. The user program generates the logical address and thinks that the program is running in this logical address but the program needs physical memory for its execution, therefore, the logical address must be mapped to the physical address by MMU before they are used. The term Physical Address Space is used for all physical addresses corresponding to the logical addresses in a Logical address space.

2. [Memory Allocation](https://www.cs.uah.edu/~rcoleman/Common/C_Reference/MemoryAlloc.html#:~:text=Memory%20allocation%20is%20the%20process,of%20a%20structure%20or%20class.)<br>
Memory allocation is the process of setting aside sections of memory in a program to be used to store variables, and instances of structures and classes. There are two basic types of memory allocation: Static Memory Allocation, Dynamic Memory Allocation. When we declare a variable or an instance of a structure or class. The memory for that object is allocated by the operating system. The name we declare for the object can then be used to access that block of memory. When we use dynamic memory allocation, we have the operating system designate a block of memory of the appropriate size while the program is running. This is done either with the new operator or with a call to the malloc function. The block of memory is allocated and a pointer to the block is returned. This is then stored in a pointer to the appropriate data type.

3. [Swapping](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_memory_management.htm)<br>
Swapping is a mechanism in which a process can be swapped temporarily out of main memory to secondary storage and make that memory available to other processes. At some later time, the system swaps back the process from the secondary storage to main memory. Though performance is usually affected by swapping process but it helps in running multiple and big processes in parallel and that's the reason Swapping is also known as a technique for memory compaction.

4. [Paging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paging)<br>
Paging is a memory management scheme by which a computer stores and retrieves data from secondary storage for use in main memory. In this scheme, the operating system retrieves data from secondary storage in same-size blocks called pages. Paging is an important part of virtual memory implementations in modern operating systems, using secondary storage to let programs exceed the size of available physical memory.

5. [Fragmentation](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_memory_management.htm)<br>
As processes are loaded and removed from memory, the free memory space is broken into little pieces. It happens after sometimes that processes cannot be allocated to memory blocks considering their small size and memory blocks remains unused. This problem is known as Fragmentation. There are two types of fragmentation.
* External fragmentation. Total memory space is enough to satisfy a request or to reside a process in it, but it is not contiguous, so it cannot be used.
* Internal fragmentation. Memory block assigned to process is bigger. Some portion of memory is left unused, as it cannot be used by another process.

6. [Endianness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness)<br>
Endianness is the order or sequence of bytes of a word of digital data in computer memory. Endianness is primarily expressed as big-endian (BE) or little-endian (LE). A big-endian system stores the most significant byte of a word at the smallest memory address and the least significant byte at the largest. A little-endian system, in contrast, stores the least-significant byte at the smallest address. Endianness may also be used to describe the order in which the bits are transmitted over a communication channel. Bit-endianess is seldom used in other contexts.

7. [Page Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_table)<br>
A page table is the data structure used by a virtual memory system in a computer operating system to store the mapping between virtual addresses and physical addresses. Virtual addresses are used by the program executed by the accessing process, while physical addresses are used by the hardware, or more specifically, by the RAM subsystem. The page table is a key component of virtual address translation which is necessary to access data in memory.

8. [C Language](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/index.htm)<br>
C programming is a general-purpose, procedural, imperative computer programming language developed in 1972 by Dennis M. Ritchie at the Bell Telephone Laboratories to develop the UNIX operating system. C is the most widely used computer language. It keeps fluctuating at number one scale of popularity along with Java programming language, which is also equally popular and most widely used among modern software programmers.

9. [Linux Libraries](http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/LibraryArchives-StaticAndDynamic.html)<br>
Libraries employ a software design also known as "shared components" or "archive libraries", which groups together multiple compiled object code files into a single file known as a library. Typically C functions/C++ classes and methods which can be shared by more than one application are broken out of the application's source code, compiled and bundled into a library. There are two Linux C/C++ library types which can be created. Static libraries, a library of object code which is linked with, and becomes part of the application. The other one is dynamically linked shared object libraries. There is only one form of this library but it can be used in two ways. Dynamically linked at run time. The libraries must be available during compile/link phase. The shared objects are not included into the executable component but are tied to the execution. Dynamically loaded/unloaded and linked during execution (i.e. browser plug-in) using the dynamic linking loader system functions.

10. [Hardware Access Protection](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hardware-protection-and-type-of-hardware-protection/)<br>
Hardware protection is divided into 3 categories: CPU protection, Memory Protection, and I/O protection.
* CPU protection. CPU protection is referred to as we can not give CPU to a process forever, it should be for some limited time otherwise other processes will not get the chance to execute the process. So for that, a timer is used to get over from this situation.
* Memory protection. Memory protection is used for situation when two or more processes are in memory and one process may want to access the other process memory.
* I/O protection. I/O protection is to prevent some cases to never occur in the system. These cases are termination of other I/O process, viewing I/O of other process, giving priority to a particular I/O process.
