# Top 10 List of Week 07

1. [Semaphore](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/semaphores-in-operating-system)<br>
Semaphores are variables that are used to solve the critical section problem by using atomic operations. There are two types of semaphores:
* Counting semaphores. The semaphore count is the number of available resources. These semaphores are used to coordinate the resource access.
* Binary semaphores. This semaphore is like counting semaphore, but the value is restricted to 0 and 1. The signal operation works when semaphore is 0, where as the wait operation works when semaphore is 1.

2. [Atomic Operations](https://wiki.osdev.org/Atomic_operation)<br>
An atomic operation is an operation that will always be executed without any other process being able to read or change variable that is used on the operation. It is important in algorithms that deal with multiple independent processes.

3. [Race Condition](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/race-condition-critical-section-and-semaphore)<br>
A race condition is a situation that may occur inside a critical section. This happens when the result of multiple thread execution in critical section differs according to the order in which the threads execute. 

4. [Critical Section](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/g-fact-70/)<br>
Critical section is a code where it can be accessed by multiple processes. Critical section contains shared variables or resources which are needed to be synchronized to maintain consistency of data variable. 

5. [Deadlock](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/7_Deadlocks.html)<br>
Deadlock happens when a thread is in waiting state and the resources it's waiting are being held by other waiting threads. An illustration for deadlock can be drawn by an old law: "When two trains approach each other at a crossing, both shall come to a full stop and neither shall start up again until the other has gone.". So neither will be able to start again because they're both waiting for the other to start. There are four conditions necessary to achieve deadlock:
* Mutual Exclusion. At least one resource must be held in a non-sharable mode.
* Hold and Wait. A process must be holding at least one resource and waiting for at least one resource that is currently being held by some other process.
* No Preemption. Once a process is holding resource, then that resource cannot be taken away from that process until the process voluntarirly releases it.
* Circular Wait. A set of process must exist such that every process is waiting for other processes.

6. [Livelock](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deadlock-starvation-and-livelock/)<br>
Livelock occurs when there are two or more processes countinously repeats the same interaction to change the other processes. These processes are running concurrently and not in waiting state. This is different from deadlock because the processes aren't in waiting state, unlike deadlock.

7. [Deadlock Detection](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/7_Deadlocks.html)<br>
There are two algorithm to detect deadlock:
* Single Instance Detection Algorithm. If every resource category has a single instance, then we can use a wait-for resource-allocation graph. A wait-for graph can be constructed from a resource-allocation graph by eliminating the resource and collapsing the associated edge.
* Several Instance Detection Algorithm. This algorithm is used when each resource category has multiple instance. The detection algorithm is similar to Banker's algorithm. 

8. [Deadlock Handling](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/7_Deadlocks.html)<br>
There are three ways to handle deadlock:
* Ignore the problem and pretend deadlock never happen in the system.
* Use protocols to prevent and avoid deadlock, ensuring the system will never get deadlock.
* Let the system get deadlock, detect the deadlock, and then recover the system.

9. [Deadlock Avoidance](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/7_Deadlocks.html)<br>
Deadlock avoidence is to prevent deadlock happening by preventing the deadlock condition. This requires more information for each processes and leads to low device utilization. Several ways to avoid deadlock:
* Safe state. The system can allocate resources to each thread without entering deadlock state.
* Resource-Allocation graph algorithm. If we have a resource-allocation system with only one instance of each resource type, we can use a variant of the resource-allocation graph.
* Banker's algorithm. When a new thread enters the system, it must declare the maximum number of instances of each resource type that it may need. If it did, the resources are allocated. If not, the thread must wait until some other thread releases enough resources.

10. [Deadlock Recovery](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/recovery-from-deadlock-in-operating-system/)<br>
There are two ways to recover from deadlock:
* Process and Thread Termination. We can kill one or more processes. There are two methods. The first one is to abort all deadlocked processes. The second one is to abort one process at a time until the deadlock is eliminated.
* Resource preemption. Preempt some resources from a process, then give those resources to other processes.
